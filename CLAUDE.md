## What This Project Is

A **diagnostic, cross-country macro-regime dashboard** in the Ray Dalio "Economic Machine" tradition. It ingests macroeconomic data from free/open APIs, normalizes it into a standardized `Signal` contract, classifies each economy into one of four macro seasons (Expansion, Inflationary Boom, Disinflationary Slowdown, Stagflation), and presents a multi-panel diagnostic terminal.

**This is a diagnostic tool, not an allocator.** No portfolio construction, risk-parity weights, or trade recommendations are produced here. Those belong to the separate Allocation Layer project.

## Locked-In Paths

| Purpose | Path |
| :--- | :--- |
| Project root | `/mnt/data/projects/all_weather/indicators_machine/` |
| Data / cache | `/mnt/data/project_data/all_weather/indicators_machine/` |
| Database | `/mnt/data/db/all_weather/indicators_machine/` |
| Main DB file | `/mnt/data/db/all_weather/indicators_machine/signals.duckdb` |
| Raw API cache | `/mnt/data/project_data/all_weather/indicators_machine/raw_cache/` |
| Parquet snapshots | `/mnt/data/project_data/all_weather/indicators_machine/snapshots/` |

**Never change these paths.** All code must read them from config/env vars, not hardcode strings.

## Non-Negotiable Build Rules

### 1. Dockerize everything
- Every runnable component (ingestion pipeline, scheduler, Streamlit dashboard) must have a `Dockerfile` or be a service in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Local dev is fine in a venv, but the acceptance test for any phase is `docker compose up`.
- Use bind mounts for the data/db paths above — do not bake data into images.

### 2. Use existing packages before building from scratch
Before writing any utility from scratch, check whether it is already available in:
`fredapi`, `wbgapi`, `sdmx`, `imfp`, `duckdb`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `streamlit`, `plotly`, `APScheduler`, `pydantic`, `requests`, `tenacity`, `python-dotenv`

Only write custom code when a package genuinely cannot do the job.

### 3. Never hardcode secrets
API keys (`FRED_API_KEY`, `EIA_API_KEY`) are read from a `.env` file / environment variables only. The code must fail loudly with a clear error if a required key is missing — never substitute stub data silently.

### 4. Never invent or assume series IDs
Every `⚠ VERIFY` ID in the spec must be confirmed via the provider's search/metadata endpoint before first ingestion. Confirmed IDs and their human-readable titles must be written back to the binding config. An empty/all-null result from ingestion is a **failure**, not a success.

### 5. Cache raw API responses on first pull
Cache to `raw_cache/` (DuckDB or parquet) on first successful pull. Develop against the cache. This keeps iteration fast and protects rate-limited APIs.

### 6. Make ingestion idempotent
Upsert on `(id, as_of)`. Re-running the pipeline must not duplicate rows.

### 7. Never forward-fill past a release cycle without setting `is_stale=true`
Preserve native frequency for statistics. Set `is_stale=true` when a series has not updated within its expected release window.

### 8. `vintage_available=true` only where point-in-time data genuinely exists
Currently: US series via FRED API only. All other countries use latest-revised data and must set `vintage_available=false`.

## Current Status

**As of 2026-06-18:** Phase 1A-i complete and verified.

| Sub-phase | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1A-i FRED lenses A–E + Master | ✅ **Done** | 37/37 signals live in DuckDB, 51 tests pass |
| 1A-ii World Bank lenses F/G/H/demo | ⬜ Next | `wbgapi`; external, capital, governance, demographics |
| 1A-iii IMF/OECD fiscal lenses | ⬜ Pending | `imfp`/SDMX; structural balance, revenue/GDP |
| 1B Composites engine | ⬜ Pending | Growth Score, Inflation Score, Regime Quadrant |
| 1C Streamlit dashboard | ⬜ Pending | 4-quadrant scatter, accordions, conflict panel |
| 2 Country rollout | ⬜ Pending | Eurozone first |
| 3 Back-test / regime replay | ⬜ Pending | FRED vintages |

**To start the next session:** `python3 -m indicators.pipeline --latest` to inspect current signals, then proceed with 1A-ii or 1B.

## Phase Map

### Phase 1A-i — FRED-only lenses A–E + Master ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-18)
- DuckDB schema, `Signal` contract, Pydantic models
- `fredapi` loader with parquet cache + tenacity retry
- Transform, normalize, momentum, equilibrium-distance, staleness
- 29 FRED series + 4 derived (lenses A–E + Master); 37/37 signals verified live
- 51 unit + integration tests passing
- Known: Philly Fed PMI series ID corrected; ICE BofA HY spread truncated to 2023 (G-10)

### Phase 1A-ii — World Bank lenses ← **next**
1. Add `wbgapi` fetcher to `indicators/loader.py`.
2. Add WB bindings to `config/us_bindings.yaml`: Lens F (external), G (capital/currency), H (governance/WGI), demographics.
3. Verify each WB series ID before ingesting.
4. **Acceptance gate:** WB series ingest, no empty results, sanity checks pass.

### Phase 1A-iii — IMF/OECD fiscal lenses
1. Add `imfp` / SDMX fetcher.
2. Add fiscal bindings: `GGXONLB`, `GGSB`, `GC.REV.XGRT.GD.ZS`.
3. **Acceptance gate:** fiscal series ingest and sanity check.

### Phase 1B — Composites & Snapshot Engine
1. Daily orchestration compiles current signal state.
2. Compute Growth Score, Inflation Score, Regime Quadrant (+ Confidence %), Disequilibrium Score.
3. Archive composite snapshots to time-indexed DuckDB tables.
4. **Acceptance gate:** DB resolves multi-year composite timeline; quadrant labels match historical regimes visually.

### Phase 1C — Streamlit Dashboard (US proof)
1. Build the §5.1 grid: HUD, 4-quadrant Plotly scatter with 12-month tail, accordions A–I.
2. Percentile color badges, data-quality badges, causal-linkage tooltips, Geopolitical-Risk Overlay.
3. "What Changed This Week/Quarter" feed, Cross-Signal Conflict Panel.
4. **Acceptance gate:** `docker compose up` → dashboard renders, queries DuckDB, color is driven by percentile, manual refresh works.

### Phase 2 — Country Rollout (one at a time)
Order: Eurozone → Japan → UK → South Korea → China → India → Brazil → Saudi Arabia → Russia.
Each country requires: binding instantiation → series verification → spot-check vs. public reference → `vintage_available` set honestly → human sign-off.

### Phase 3 — Back-Test / Regime Replay
Replay named scenarios (1970s stagflation, 2008 GFC, 2020 COVID) using FRED vintages. Confirm quadrant classifier lands in expected season with no look-ahead bias.

## Deferred / Out of Scope (do not build)

- Risk-parity weighting, volatility estimation, correlation matrices, portfolio construction → **Allocation Layer project**
- EIU / ICRG political-risk scores → use WB WGI as live substitute
- EM-DAT disaster losses (Lens I) → build slot + deferred binding only
- SWF holdings → deferred
- CEIC / Bloomberg / Refinitiv → only if a license is provided
- NBS China automated pull → use WB/IMF harmonized for now
- Russia Rosstat/CBR automated → use WB/IMF harmonized; flag gaps
