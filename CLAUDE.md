## What This Project Is

A **diagnostic, cross-country macro-regime dashboard** in the Ray Dalio "Economic Machine" tradition. It ingests macroeconomic data from free/open APIs, normalizes it into a standardized `Signal` contract, and reads each economy on three clocks: a **two-chip short-term regime** (Growth: Growth/Transition/Retraction × Inflation: Inflation/Transition/Disinflation — dual-condition Z + momentum thresholds, optionally dynamic per Ray's algorithm), a **long-term debt-cycle stage** (leveraging / squeeze / deleveraging / reflation), and a **big-cycle order read** (Gini, reserve-currency share). The classic four macro seasons (Expansion, Inflationary Boom, Disinflationary Slowdown, Stagflation) survive only as threshold-aware map geography on the Regime Map — display shorthand, not the decision rule.

**This is a diagnostic tool, not an allocator.** No portfolio construction, risk-parity weights, or trade recommendations are produced here. Those belong to the separate Allocation Layer project.

## Locked-In Paths

| Purpose | Path |
| :--- | :--- |
| Project root | `/mnt/data/projects/all_weather/indicators_machine/` |
| Data / cache | `/mnt/data/project_data/all_weather/indicators_machine/` |
| Database | `/mnt/data/db/all_weather/indicators_machine/` |
| Main DB file | `/mnt/data/db/all_weather/indicators_machine/signals.duckdb` |
| Raw API cache | `/mnt/data/project_data/all_weather/indicators_machine/raw_cache/` |
| Parquet snapshots | `/mnt/data/project_data/all_weather/indicators_machine/snapshots/` |

**Never change these paths.** All code must read them from config/env vars, not hardcode strings.

---

## Non-Negotiable Build Rules

### 1. Dockerize everything
- Every runnable component (ingestion pipeline, scheduler, Streamlit dashboard) must have a `Dockerfile` or be a service in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Local dev is fine in a venv, but the acceptance test for any phase is `docker compose up`.
- Use bind mounts for the data/db paths above — do not bake data into images.

### 2. Use existing packages before building from scratch
Before writing any utility from scratch, check whether it is already available in:
`fredapi`, `wbgapi`, `sdmx`, `imfp`, `duckdb`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `streamlit`, `plotly`, `APScheduler`, `pydantic`, `requests`, `tenacity`, `python-dotenv`

Only write custom code when a package genuinely cannot do the job.

### 3. Never hardcode secrets
API keys (`FRED_API_KEY`, `EIA_API_KEY`) are read from a `.env` file / environment variables only. The code must fail loudly with a clear error if a required key is missing — never substitute stub data silently.

### 4. Never invent or assume series IDs
Every `⚠ VERIFY` ID in the spec must be confirmed via the provider's search/metadata endpoint before first ingestion. Confirmed IDs and their human-readable titles must be written back to the binding config. An empty/all-null result from ingestion is a **failure**, not a success.

### 5. Cache raw API responses on first pull
Cache to `raw_cache/` (DuckDB or parquet) on first successful pull. Develop against the cache. This keeps iteration fast and protects rate-limited APIs.

### 6. Make ingestion idempotent
Upsert on `(id, as_of)`. Re-running the pipeline must not duplicate rows.

### 7. Never forward-fill past a release cycle without setting `is_stale=true`
Preserve native frequency for statistics. Set `is_stale=true` when a series has not updated within its expected release window.

### 8. `vintage_available=true` only where point-in-time data genuinely exists
Currently: US series via FRED API only. All other countries use latest-revised data and must set `vintage_available=false`.

## Current Status

**As of 2026-07-07 (5):** Everything below still holds. **Country coverage expanded to 14 economies, 462 signals** on a Digital Ray consult. Ray reviewed the list (log in `ray_dalio_review_log.md` Session 2026-07-07): endorsed Brazil, flagged **Switzerland marginal** + **Germany/Luxembourg borderline-redundant** with the EZ aggregate, and named his top missing economies — all **commodity/trade hubs**: Canada, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia (the set was heavy on debt-cycle pillars, light on commodity exporters; he ranked the original spec's Saudi/Russia BELOW these). User chose "the ones Ray suggested" → **built Brazil + Canada + Australia + Mexico + Indonesia** (dropped standalone Switzerland). New codes: BR/CA/AU/MX/ID (loader WB+IMF maps updated). All 5 carry BIS 3-sector credit → **all run the private/sovereign two-vote stage split**; stage reads BR/CA/MX=squeeze, AU=leveraging, ID=reflation; no gov-interest series → SOVEREIGN SQUEEZE flags can't fire. Data quirks (full detail in `data_source_wishlist.md`): BR rate=discount/Selic (no bond yield), CA richest (live IP+10y+3m+unemployment), AU quarterly CPI + no monthly IP, MX trade-only growth (no IP/no live unemployment), ID call-money rate + no IP. WB external debt fills for BR/MX/ID (EMs), null for CA/AU. Wired into all dashboards; Methodology §11/§15. 3 new tests; suite **442 passed, zero exclusions**. **Next: Ray's next tier (Vietnam/Turkey/South Africa/Saudi/Singapore; Russia = no-Rosstat constraint), or the standing D4/CPI-feed tails.**

**As of 2026-07-07 (4):** Everything below still holds. **D4 complete — manual-load infrastructure** (the last unbuilt ORDER-layer piece): drop-folder pattern at `MANUAL_DATA_DIR` (default `DATA_DIR/manual_data/`, wired into docker-compose), `fetch_manual_series()` loader (per-signal `date,value` CSVs; bare years → year-end; **missing file = pending [SLOT], never an error; malformed file fails loudly**), pipeline **Pass 3.8** (`provider: Manual`, `results["slot"]` counted separately, "Pending slots: N" in summaries), **15 Manual bindings** — `order.governance` (V-Dem `v2x_libdem`) × 8 countries + `order.geopolitical_risk` (GPR `GPRC_{ISO3}`) × 7 (LU is not in the GPR set; no EZ aggregate for either), converter scripts `scripts/prepare_vdem.py` + `scripts/prepare_gpr.py` (needs `xlrd`, operator-side), docs at `docs/manual_data.md` (mirrored as the drop folder's README). CC big-cycle card shows V-Dem/GPR when files land and names the specific pending slots until then. **To fill the slots, follow the step-by-step runbook in [docs/manual_data.md](docs/manual_data.md)** (download V-Dem CY-Core from v-dem.net + data_gpr_export.xls from matteoiacoviello.com, run the two converters, re-run the pipeline — no code changes needed). The "order score" composite stays deliberately unbuilt until the drops prove stable. 9 new tests (`tests/test_manual_load.py`); suite **440 passed, zero exclusions**.

**As of 2026-07-07 (3):** Everything below still holds. **India + Germany + Luxembourg rollouts complete — 9 economies, 308 signals** (73 US + 37 EZ + 32 CN + 32 IN + 29 DE + 27 GB + 27 LU + 26 KR + 25 JP). DE/LU are user-requested standalone euro members (also inside the EZ aggregate — built for core-vs-aggregate divergence; the payoff was immediate: **DE stage = deleveraging on both votes at 0.44 while the EZ aggregate reads reflation**). **India is data-richer than China** (live monthly IP + live 10y yield + live quarterly GDP + BIS 3-sector credit + WB external debt $716B; CPI → IMF bridge; INR not in COFER); latest IN read Expansion (G +2.76), stage reflation. **Germany = richest non-US dataset** (live monthly HICP — first bridge-free non-US country; live IP via Eurostat `geo=DE`; first non-US 2-signal rate basket; BIS credit from 1970); latest DE read Stagflation (G −0.30 / I +0.39). **Luxembourg documented as a financial-center read** (BIS private credit 420% GDP = intra-group vehicles → global credit-conditions gauge, reduced quality factors; FDI/exports sanity ranges widened; growth composite under-reads LU — no free monthly financial-sector gauge); stage reflation. All three carry BIS household+corporate credit → **5 of 9 countries now run the private/sovereign two-vote split** (US/CN/IN/DE/LU); none of the new three has a gov-interest series so their SOVEREIGN SQUEEZE flags honestly never fire. Loader maps gained DE→DEU/LU→LUX. 4 new tests; suite **431 passed, zero exclusions**. **Next country: Brazil.**

**As of 2026-07-07 (2):** Everything below still holds. **China rollout complete (Phase 2, 6th economy)**: `cn_bindings.yaml` (32 signals, all endpoint-verified) + `cn_composites.yaml` (6 forces) — **220 signals total** (73 US + 37 EZ + 27 GB + 25 JP + 26 KR + 32 CN). Key findings (full detail in `data_source_wishlist.md` China section): BIS 3-sector credit is quarterly+live (private 200.8% / household 58.0% / corporate 142.8% GDP) making **CN the second country after the US with a real private/sovereign two-vote stage split**; WB external debt `DT.DOD.DECT.CD` fills for China ($2.42T — first country where it works); CNY COFER share live (1.99%); ALL OECD monthly activity feeds dead (IP/CLI/M2/quarterly-GDP/PPI) → live monthly growth reads are merchandise **exports/imports YoY** (USD, →2026-04, LNY noise documented); **no free bond yield at any maturity** → 3m interbank (`IR3TIB01CNM156N`, live) proxies the market rate everywhere incl. both stage spreads; monthly CPI ages out 2025-04 → IMF annual bridge (KR/GB pattern); unemployment = WB/ILO annual proxy. **CN stage = leveraging on both votes** (0.28 conf, 4/5 features; no gov-interest series → SOVEREIGN SQUEEZE flag honestly can't fire). Latest read: Disinflationary Slowdown (G −0.68 / I −0.77 — the 0.0% CPI deflation story). CN wired into country selector, CC, Relative Cycles, Workbench, User Guide, Data Dashboard; Methodology §11 rewritten (was stale at "Japan next") + §15 rows. 2 new tests; suite **429 passed, zero exclusions**. Known pipeline quirk: full runs exit 1 on the documented EZ current-account empty — not a failure signal for the run itself. **Next country: India.**

**As of 2026-07-07:** Everything below the 2026-07-06 entry still holds. **Sovereign-aware stage classifier rework** (Ray Dalio ruling, `ray_dalio_review_log.md` Session 2026-07-06 (3)): a user challenge — the classifier read the US as "reflation" while Ray's own public position calls for a major deleveraging — exposed that the mean-of-3-sectors debt-stock feature was diluting a record government debt stock (122.8% GDP, z +1.78) against a genuinely deleveraged private sector (household debt/GDP z −1.54, multi-decade low). Ray's ruling: **two independent stage votes** (PRIVATE + SOVEREIGN), headline = the **worse of the two by severity**; debt stock = **size-weighted mean of sector percentiles, each capped at the 90th percentile** ("worst-of without total dilution"); debt-service = **70% household DSR / 30% government interest-to-GDP**; a **refinancing-gap feature** (marginal rate − effective rate on the gov stock) triggers the sovereign vote's service condition one quarter early once it exceeds +0.75pp; and — critically — **keep the headline as "the mechanism currently operating," do NOT force-flip it, add a SEPARATE independent "Sovereign Squeeze" warning flag instead**. Live result: US headline stays reflation (r−g/ngdp−yield are genuinely reflation-shaped right now) but the **SOVEREIGN SQUEEZE flag has fired continuously since 2022-Q2** (refinancing gap +1.81pp, gov-interest Z +1.43) — a multi-year early warning running underneath a correctly-described current mechanism. `DebtCycleStageSnapshot`/DB gained `stage_private`/`stage_sovereign`/`sovereign_squeeze`/`feat_gov_interest_z`/`feat_refi_gap`; Command Center, Debt Stress page, and Relative Cycles all surface the flag. GB/EZ/JP/KR unchanged (no private-debt inputs → headline = sovereign vote as before). 5 new tests; suite **427 passed, zero exclusions**.

**As of 2026-07-06:** Everything below the 2026-06-26 entry still holds; on top of it, a full **Ray Dalio AI review + implementation cycle** landed across 2026-07-05/06 — the entire Ray-framework roadmap (A–G incl. CC) is complete, 5 countries are live, and the review channel is now also used for design rulings (see the unification-audit and User-Guide sessions in the review log). **Workbench added 2026-07-06** (`dashboard/workbench.py` + `workbench_data.py`, route `/workbench`; `/charts` + `/explorer` are legacy routes): TV-style omnibox search over all 321 plottable series, overlay + stacked modes with per-series transforms, synced crosshair, per-series inspector drawer (explorer_data.py reused; explorer UI archived), saved views in `DATA_DIR/saved_views.json` (NOT the DB — reader/writer lock) + presets + `?view=` deep links; replaces Chart Overlay + Data Explorer. **UI cleanup 2026-07-06:** the pre-Ray surfaces are retired to `archive/` (standalone Regime Classifier page/engine, Streamlit :8501 proof, TradingView :8503/:8004 SPA) — docker-compose is now 2 services (pipeline + charting); deprecated `composites.yaml` deleted; Regime History help panel/agreement labels rewritten to chip language; Weight Audit Monte Carlo uses threshold-aware season zones. Authoritative docs: `docs/Guidance/ray_dalio_review_log.md` (24-item punch list, all implemented or explicitly deferred), `docs/Guidance/ray_framework_roadmap.md` (phased build plan A–H toward the 5-layer Ray-framework dashboard — **read this first when picking up build work**), `docs/Guidance/data_source_wishlist.md` (open data-feed research). Highlights: **421 tests pass, zero exclusions** (the long-standing dtype failure is fixed) (1 known pre-existing dtype failure in `test_compare_raw_vs_processed_level_signal`); 188 signals (73 US + 37 EZ + 27 GB + 25 JP + 26 KR). **Six force composites** now (added `volatility_score` — realized vol + VIX for US, monthly proxy EZ/KR — and `productivity_score` — Ray's third big force, with a /signals/productivity page overlaying cyclical growth). Growth basket reweighted via GDP-regression calibration; breakevens merged into `inflation.breakeven_avg`; Credit gained the SLOOS demand side (`credit.loan_demand`); Rate gained `policy.rate_expectations` (= yield_2y − fed_funds, Ray's pick — the FEDTARMD dot-plot is a future-dated forecast snapshot, NOT usable as a signal). **Opt-in dynamic regime thresholds** (Ray's 7-step algorithm: country-vol-scaled baseline × credit multiplier × volatility multiplier + divergence flag) via a checkbox in the Regime Thresholds modal — off by default; checkbox applies instantly (no Apply click). **Backtest engine** `indicators/backtest.py` (Phase G1+G2): point-in-time expanding-window replay, 8 scenarios 1983→2026 — direction validation passed (~0% wrong-direction), dynamic ≥ fixed (2 wins, 6 ties) but stays opt-in pending G3 (ALFRED vintages + asset-outcome tests). Debt Stress: dynamic stock/flow weighting, missing-annual interpolation, sparse-country 3-component fallback documented in `longterm_stress.yaml`. CHI: conditional weight tilt + nominal/real rate toggle. Methodology page: all sections updated + new **Section 15 Revision Log** (log every formula/weight/threshold change there) + Section 8 "what feeds the regime label" diagram. **Phase CC done**: `dashboard/command_center.py` is the new default landing page (routes `/` + `/country`, "🎛 Command Center" nav at top of Overviews) — regime strip (chips honor dynamic thresholds; DYNAMIC + amber DIVERGENCE badges — the latter closes review-log #23's follow-up), short-cycle lever cards (Growth/Inflation dials with Δ + momentum, Credit supply `lending_standards` + demand `loan_demand`, Policy stance `rate_score` + 2y−funds hikes/hold/cuts read), Debt Stress + DSR cards, productivity-vs-cycle card, what-changed top-8 feed, dashed Phase C/D placeholder cards; every card links to its detail page; lazy-imports from `dashboard.charting` inside the callback to avoid circular imports. **Phase G3 done 2026-07-06 (Phase G complete)**: `indicators/backtest_g3.py` — ALFRED vintage replay (15/19 basket signals; `raw_cache/alfred_{id}.parquet`), chip-conditioned forward returns (558-month bond test: Inflation chip → −10%/yr fwd bond returns vs +5% Disinflation), rate_expectations IC test. Verdicts: direction validation survives vintage replay (wrong-direction ≈0% on as-known data); **A1 closed — rate_expectations keeps its slot at CONTEXT 0.45** (incremental IC +0.15); dynamic thresholds stay opt-in; stage calibration confirmed except the late-engaging 2007 squeeze (tweak candidate, not tuned). Report: `docs/backtests/pit_regime_backtest_g3_us.md`. **Phase F done (Japan)**: `jp_bindings.yaml` (25 signals, all FRED IDs endpoint-verified) + `jp_composites.yaml` (6 forces) — 161 signals total (73 US + 37 EZ + 25 JP + 26 KR); JP inflation = IMF annual bridge ONLY (all OECD FRED JP CPI feeds dead since 2021-06; e-Stat API needs registration → wishlist); JP volatility = TRUE daily Nikkei realized vol (NIKKEI225 free daily on FRED); JP stage = reflation (4/5 features); Pass 7 moved after country loop; country selector enabled; JP inflation corr +0.03 vs US last-10y = the only real diversifier; JP Debt Stress composite not built (model stays US-only). **Phase D done (spike + subset)**: big-cycle ORDER lens — research spike verified WB Gini ✔ (US/KR; EMU empty), IMF COFER reserve shares ✔ via NEW IMF SDMX 2.1 API (`api.imf.org`, `fetch_imf_sdmx_series()`, pipeline Pass 3.5, provider `IMF_SDMX`, series_id `"DATAFLOW/KEY"`), WB external debt ✘ null for high-income, V-Dem/GPR ✘ no API (manual-load slots, open as D4); 4 new `order.*` structural signals (136 total: 73 US + 37 EZ + 26 KR), feed no composite; CC Big-cycle card live-partial. **Phase C done**: long-term debt-cycle STAGE classifier (`indicators/debt_cycle_stage.py` + `config/debt_cycle_stage.yaml`, all TUNABLE) — leveraging/squeeze/deleveraging/reflation/neutral from 5 feature families (debt/GDP shift-1 expanding percentile + 3y trajectory, DSR 2y trend, r−g, ngdp−yield), weighted-condition argmax with missing-feature renormalization (EZ/KR run on 4/5), 3-quarter mode smoothing (never across data gaps); `debt_cycle_stage_snapshots` table, pipeline Pass 7, CC Cycle Stage card live + Debt Stress page stage band/score section; current: US=reflation EZ=reflation KR=leveraging; threshold calibration deferred to G3. **Phase E done**: `dashboard/relative_view.py` (route `/relative`, "🌍 Relative Cycles" nav) — per-country three-clock cards (regime chips + stage chip + scores + order reads) and 4 cycle-correlation heatmaps (growth/inflation × full-history/10y; month-period alignment; <24 common months → NaN); today's answer: US–EZ growth 0.86 last-10y, US–KR 0.53, inflation 0.84–0.90 everywhere (no inflation diversification); extend `relative_view.COUNTRIES` when adding countries. **User Guide added 2026-07-06** (`dashboard/user_guide.py`, route `/guide`, "🎓 User Guide" nav in Reference): 9-lesson training course on the Ray-reviewed tools with live per-country data in every lesson; Ray pedagogy pass first — 3 newcomer traps front-loaded (Z≠grade, magnitude≠direction, never the two dials alone), debt-cycle hook before dial mechanics, L0 machine diagram with data-source labels + credit loop + adaptive band. **Unification audit done 2026-07-06** (Ray session, rulings in `ray_dalio_review_log.md`): rolling composite columns backfilled for ALL countries (were US-only — sliders silently fell back to full-history elsewhere) and now computed in the pipeline country loop; canonical window defaults **48m growth / 90m inflation** (Ray ruled 96m → nearest grid; policy 36m deferred, rate basket has no rolling variants); Command Center honors the sidebar window stores ("window 48m/90m" annotation); Relative Cycles normalizes every country on the canonical windows (Q1b); Regime Map four-season names are now backdrop-only beyond the ±threshold lines with "Transition — no clear season" inside the band (`_season_label()` replaces all sign-based quadrant derivations); confidence renamed **Chip Direction Agreement** (per-force % of signals moving with the chip's heading, G/I sub-metrics, on CC header + Regime Map card; legacy `confidence` column retained as fallback). **UK rolled out 2026-07-06** (`gb_bindings.yaml` 27 signals all endpoint-verified + `gb_composites.yaml` 6 forces): monthly CPI ages out 2025-03 → IMF bridge (ONS API, free/unregistered, is the live-replacement candidate); no daily FTSE → monthly-proxy volatility; ILO monthly unemployment = `LRHUTTTTGBM156S`. **GB stage = squeeze at 0.53 confidence — the strongest stage read of any country** (debt 102% GDP, gilts 4.94% vs +0.9% real growth). Country dropdown fully live (no more "soon" entries). GB inflation corr 0.94 vs EZ — JP remains the only inflation diversifier. **All major roadmap phases (A–G incl. CC) are complete.** Remaining open items: China rollout (next in Phase 2 order; WB/IMF harmonized only), D4 (manual-load governance/GPR slots), ONS/e-Stat registrations for live GB/JP monthly CPI, the pre-existing dtype test failure, and the 2007-squeeze stage-threshold tweak candidate.

**As of 2026-06-26:** Phases 1A–1I complete. Phase 2 in progress: EZ (34 signals) + KR (22 signals) live. **354 tests pass.** 121 signals total (65 US + 34 EZ + 22 KR). Signals page (/signals) live — 5-force breakdown with 8-column Force Component Inputs table, composite momentum score in section headers (semantically color-coded). **Force detail sub-pages** (`/signals/{force}` for growth/inflation/rate/credit/volatility): banner strip (Force Z · Momentum · Active · In Agreement · Threshold · Lookback), collapsible 8-column signal table, stacked composite-Z + per-signal dual-panel (raw + Z) chart with shared spike hover; composite chart uses rolling-window variant matching banner and Regime History; all dates normalized to month-start for visual alignment. **Rate/Credit composites**: `rate_score`/`credit_score`/`rate_momentum`/`credit_momentum` DB columns; weight_audit JSON includes all 4 forces. **Per-signal age-decay half-lives**: rate basket (3m/3m/3m/4m/6m/6m); credit basket (3m/4m/4m/6m/9m/9m/12m); engine reads `half_life_months` from composites YAML. 65 US signals (new: `credit.corporate_debt_gdp` → FRED QUSNAM770A, BIS corporate credit % GDP quarterly). Signal drill-down modal (click any signal name → dual/triple panel chart: computed value + Z-score + raw underlying level for FRED yoy_pct signals). Signal info popup (ⓘ icon → provider, units, series title, raw FRED units, last updated). Shared vertical spike hover across all subplot panels. FRED metadata sidecar cache (`fred_{id}_meta.json`, 76 series). Dark-theme palette: lerp from washed-out light to vivid (fully opaque) replacing low-alpha rgba. Debt stress: FYFSD+FYOINT+FGRECPT FRED replacements for dropped IMF/WB annual components; 7/7 components now active. **Configurable regime classification**: replaced 4-season badge with two independent chips — Growth (Growth/Transition/Retraction) and Inflation (Inflation/Transition/Disinflation); dual-condition (Z + MoM delta) thresholds configurable via "Regime Thresholds" amber button (top-right of Regime History header); `regime-threshold-store` (localStorage); threshold-aware Z-score colors on both Regime History and Signals pages; scatter chart shows ±gz/±iz threshold lines; Regime History Row 1 = dual-band scatter (Growth y=0.25, Inflation y=0.75); live G·Z/I·Z/G·Δ/I·Δ display inline in header; slider dark-theme overrides (amber text, dark bg, hidden tooltips). **Force detail chart polish** (2026-06-26): composite Z panel now styled with `fill="tozeroy"` force-color shading + amber ±threshold hlines (matching Regime History); new amber momentum panel (Row 2) for growth/inflation/rate/credit pages. **Rolling Z fix**: `load_signal_history` allowlist expanded; per-signal Z panels now use the selected rolling window column. **Signals subnav collapse**: pure-CSS collapse (`max-height` transition, `:hover` + `:has(.active)`) with `active="partial"` on the Signals NavLink. **Repo private**: `github.com/benito334/indicators-machine` set to PRIVATE.

**To start the next session:** the Ray-framework roadmap (`docs/Guidance/ray_framework_roadmap.md`) is **complete through Phase G**, and Phase 2 covers 14 economies (US/EZ/GB/JP/KR/CN/IN/DE/LU/BR/CA/AU/MX/ID, 462 signals). Open items, in rough priority: **Ray tier-2 country rollouts** (his ranked missing list continues: Vietnam, Turkey, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore — Russia hits the no-Rosstat constraint; expect the BR/IN pattern), **fill the D4 manual slots** (download V-Dem CY-Core + GPR xls, run scripts/prepare_*.py, re-run pipeline — infra is built), ONS registration-free API for live GB monthly CPI + e-Stat registration for JP, no free German core-CPI series (wishlist), and the 2007-squeeze stage-threshold tweak candidate (needs more episodes before tuning). BEA note: `debt_service_ratio` refreshed with Q1 2026; `current_account`/`NIIP` still awaiting BEA publication (re-run pipeline when released). EZ current account gap remains unresolvable from free APIs — documented in `docs/Guidance/EU_singals_guidance.md`; Global Overview shows dash.

**Signal drill-down + info popup notes (as of 2026-06-25):**
- Click signal name → `{"type": "signal-link", "index": sig_id}` → `signal-drill-id` store → modal with 2-panel (level/Z) or 3-panel chart (+ raw FRED cache for yoy_pct signals). Shared hover spike via clientside callback on `signal-drill-chart` figure.
- Click ⓘ icon → `{"type": "info-icon", "index": sig_id}` → `signal-info-id` store → compact modal with description, units, raw FRED units (from `fred_{id}_meta.json` sidecar), frequency, provider, last updated.
- `_load_signal_binding(signal_id)` in `charting.py`: reads `config/us_bindings.yaml` or `config/countries/{cc}_bindings.yaml`.
- `get_fred_meta(series_id)` in `loader.py`: reads/writes `raw_cache/fred_{id}_meta.json` sidecar (365-day TTL). 76 sidecars backfilled 2026-06-25.
- Dark-theme palette: `_lerp_rgb(t, lo, hi)` + `_CLR_GREEN_LO/HI` + `_CLR_RED_LO/HI` in `shared_components.py`. Used by `_semantic_z_color`, `_momentum_score_color` (signals_page), `_stress_z_color`, `_sem_z_color` (charting). Replaces `rgba(color, alpha)` blending which disappeared on dark backgrounds.

**Phase 2 architecture notes (as of 2026-06-23):**
- Country files: `config/countries/{xx}_bindings.yaml` — pipeline auto-discovers all `*_bindings.yaml` in this dir
- Internal country codes: `EZ` (signal IDs: `ez.*`), `KR` (signal IDs: `kr.*`), `JP` (signal IDs: `jp.*`)
- `_WB_COUNTRY_MAP` in `loader.py`: `EZ→EMU`, `KR→KOR`, `JP→JPN`, etc. — handles WB API country codes
- `raw_scale` field on `CountryBinding`: divide raw fetched value by this factor before transformation; used for OECD FRED `CTGYM`/`GYS`-suffix series (already in YoY% form), e.g. KR CPI (`raw_scale: 100`). Also applies to IMF signals and WB `NY.GDP.MKTP.CD` (1e9 for billions).
- IMF Datamapper does NOT support `EUR` (Euro area aggregate) — no IMF bindings for EZ
- **Eurostat JSON stats API** (`fetch_eurostat_series()` in `loader.py`): provides EZ growth data. Correct geo codes: `EA21` (unemployment), `EA20` (industrial prod, retail sales, construction, capacity util, fiscal). Correct adjustment: `s_adj=CA` (calendar) for PCH_SM series; `s_adj=SCA` returns empty for EA20 in `sts_copr_m`. Dataset codes: `une_rt_m`, `sts_inpr_m`, `sts_trtu_m`, `sts_copr_m`, `ei_bsin_q_r2`, `namq_10_pe`, `gov_10q_ggnfa`, `gov_10dd_edpt1`.
- **ECB SDW fetcher** (`fetch_ecb_series(flow, key)` in `loader.py`): SDMX-JSON 1.0 API (`data-api.ecb.europa.eu`). `series_id` in bindings is `"FLOW/KEY"` format (e.g. `"IRS/M.DE.L.L40.CI.0000.EUR.N.Z"`). Pass 1.6 in pipeline. IRS flow = Long-term Interest Rate Statistics (Maastricht yields). BOP/BP6/BPS flows return HTTP 400 in this env.
- **EZ current account**: all free API sources exhausted — WB EMU (null), ECB flows (400/404), FRED (no EA series), Eurostat `bop_c6_q` (413 regardless of params), IMF (empty for all EA codes). Documented in `docs/Guidance/EU_singals_guidance.md`. Not solvable without ECB Data License.
- **KR monthly CPI gap**: OECD FRED feed ended Apr 2025. Bridge via `inflation.cpi_imf_annual` (`PCPIPCH`/KOR, annual, `raw_scale: 100`, `is_proxy: true`). OECD direct SDMX API returns 404 in this env (all endpoints tested). BoK ECOS API requires registration.
- **Current quadrants**: EZ = Inflationary Boom 67% conf; KR = Expansion 25% conf (single annual inflation bridge); US = Inflationary Boom 47% conf (growth=+0.015, inflation=+0.434; crude oil stale-exclusion bug fixed 2026-06-25).
- **Per-country composites config** (added 2026-06-22):
  - `config/composites_policy.yaml` — global methodology (dynamic_weighting, time_decay, per_frequency_ffill_limit, `min_signals_required=1`, disequilibrium force groups, what_changed)
  - `config/countries/{cc}_composites.yaml` — per-country indicator lists with weights (growth_score + inflation_score)
  - `load_composites_config(country="US")` in `composites.py` merges both; **errors loudly** if `{cc}_composites.yaml` is missing
  - Pipeline skips composite pass with warning if no country file — safe for new countries before file is created
  - Adding a new country: create both `{cc}_bindings.yaml` AND `{cc}_composites.yaml`
  - `config/composites.yaml` is now **DEPRECATED** — marked in-file, no code reads it
- **Weight calibration system** (added 2026-06-23):
  - Importance tiers: PRIMARY (0.85–1.00), STRONG (0.60–0.84), CONTEXT (0.30–0.59), VOLATILE (0.10–0.29) — documented in every `{cc}_composites.yaml`
  - Anti-redundancy rule: if `[CORR AUDIT]` flags same-basket |r| > 0.80, secondary importance ≤ 40% of primary
  - Force-balance rule: `_log_force_balance()` in `composites.py` logs `[BALANCE]` INFO/WARN per country per Pass 5 run; target ratio 0.75–1.33
  - `audit_signal_correlations()` in `composites.py` called after each country upsert; logs `[CORR AUDIT] WARN` for flagged pairs
  - `compute_force_balance()`, `compute_signal_correlation_matrix()`, `monte_carlo_regime_sensitivity()` in `composites.py` power the Weight Audit UI page
- **Weight Audit page** (`dashboard/weight_audit.py`, route `/weight-audit`): Force Balance bar chart (all countries) + Correlation heatmaps (per country, growth + inflation baskets) + Monte Carlo scatter + donut (500 trials, ±15% importance perturbation) + Re-run button + **Importance Editor** (edit importance inline, live G/I ratio preview, reason field, save to YAML + DB) + **GDP-Regression Calibration** (`indicators/calibrate.py`; OLS each growth signal against `{cc}.master.gdp_real`, β≤0 → no recommendation, positive betas scaled to [0.10, 0.95]; "Apply Selected" populates editor for user confirmation)
- **Weight History page** (`dashboard/weight_history.py`, route `/weight-history`): table of all importance changes from `weight_change_log` DuckDB table; editable Reason column; country filter; Save Notes persists reasons
- **weight_change_log DuckDB table**: log_id, changed_at, country, signal_id, basket, old_importance, new_importance, delta, reason, source (manual/regression); written on every editor save; `log_weight_changes()`, `query_weight_change_log()`, `update_weight_change_reason()` in `store/store.py`

**:8502 Dash nav structure (as of 2026-06-22):**
- Left sidebar: country selector dropdown + vertical pill nav (Data / Indicators groups) + **Z-Score Window slider** (Full/36m/48m/60m) + **Disequilibrium Window slider** (Full/12m/18m/24m) — both persisted in localStorage; nav icons have `dbc.Tooltip` on hover in collapsed state
- Sidebar slider accent: `--slider-accent` CSS var (amber `#E8A317` Carbon, gold `#F4C842` Slate, indigo `#4C6EF5` Dawn); track tint + hover glow via `color-mix()`; thumb centered by Radix (no `top` override)
- **Data group pages**: `🌐 Global Overview` (`/overview`) — TE-style cross-country macro table (9 columns, color-coded, date-stamped); `📋 Data Dashboard` (`/data-dashboard`) — 63-signal feed monitor with sticky header, sortable columns, filter bar, status badges, ↺ Reset Sort
- **Data Dashboard sort**: clicking column header toggles asc/desc; Status column sort key: 0=stale→5=OK; flat when sorted, grouped by force when no sort active
- Regime Map page: scatter (55vh, data-driven zoom with 15% buffer) + What Changed + Conflicts + Signal Drill-Downs (10 lens accordions) + Data-Quality Log; Force Components title bar amber (`var(--slider-accent)`); selected date shows "Month Year / X months ago" block
- Methodology page: each section has inline formulas + full-section `dcc.Clipboard` copy; formulas embedded from live catalog (`build_formula_catalog()` + `build_debt_stress_formula_catalog()`); Section 12 covers importance tiers, GDP regression calibration, importance editor, weight history
- **Reference group pages**: `📖 Methodology` (`/methodology`); `🔍 Weight Audit` (`/weight-audit`); `📝 Weight History` (`/weight-history`)
- Confidence metric: always DB directional-agreement fraction; rolling quadrant-consistency override removed (was trivially 100% in multi-year Stagflation)
- Browser back/forward supported via `dcc.Location`; `page-trigger` store guarantees callback ordering
- **Dash 4.x note**: Slider CSS uses `dash-slider-*` class names (Radix UI), NOT `rc-slider-*`
- `_RQ_MAP` is module-level in `charting.py`; `zscore-window-store`/`diseq-window-store`/`inflation-window-store` use `storage_type="local"`
- **Separate Growth / Inflation Z-score windows** (added 2026-06-24): Growth = Full/36m/48m/60m (`zscore-window-store`, `_FORCE_WINDOW_COL`); Inflation = Full/60m/90m/120m (`inflation-window-store`, `_INFLATION_WINDOW_COL`). Both are independent — scatter X-axis uses growth col, Y-axis uses inflation col. New DB columns: `zscore_90m`, `zscore_120m` (signals); `inflation_score_90m`, `inflation_score_120m` (composites). Pipeline Passes 5e-5f populate them.
- **Signals page** (`dashboard/signals_page.py`, route `/signals`): 5 collapsible sections (Growth / Inflation / Interest Rate / Credit / Volatility); 8-column Force Component Inputs table (Signal / Importance / Config Wt / Eff Wt / Last Data / Z-bar / Momentum / Status); Growth and Inflation Z reflect their respective rolling window stores.
- **Configurable regime classification** (added 2026-06-25): `_classify_regime(g_score, i_score, g_delta, i_delta, thresholds)` in `charting.py` — dual-condition Z + MoM delta; returns `(g_regime, i_regime)` where each is Growth/Transition/Retraction or Inflation/Transition/Disinflation. `_DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS = {gz:0.5, iz:0.5, gm:0.0, im:0.0}`. `regime-threshold-store` (localStorage). `dbc.Button("Regime Thresholds", color="warning")` in Regime History header → `_THRESHOLD_MODAL` with four dark-styled sliders; Apply → store; Reset → defaults; auto-open guard: `(n_open or 0) > 0`. `_GROWTH_CHIP` / `_INFLAT_CHIP` dicts for chip colors. Scatter chart draws ±gz / ±iz dashed threshold lines. Regime History Row 1 = dual-band scatter. Live G·Z/I·Z/G·Δ/I·Δ display in header (`rh-threshold-display`). `_sem_z_color` uses `gz` threshold as neutral zone. Signals page `_semantic_z_color` also uses configurable `thresh`. Methodology Section 8 updated to reflect dual-condition system.

## Phase Map

### Phase 1A-i — FRED-only lenses A–E + Master ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-18)
- DuckDB schema, `Signal` contract, Pydantic models
- `fredapi` loader with parquet cache + tenacity retry
- Transform, normalize, momentum, equilibrium-distance, staleness
- 29 FRED series + 4 derived (lenses A–E + Master); 37/37 signals verified live
- 51 unit + integration tests passing
- Known: Philly Fed PMI series ID corrected; ICE BofA HY spread truncated to 2023 (G-10)

### Phase 1A-ii — World Bank lenses ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-18)
- `fetch_wb_series()` added to `loader.py` via direct REST API (not `wbgapi` — JSON-decoding issues in this env)
- 13 new bindings: Lens F (external/trade), Lens G (capital/currency), Lens A R&D, Demographics
- Lens H (governance): 5 WGI deferred slots — `.EST` series deleted/archived from WB v2 API
- Pipeline Pass 2 (WorldBank) + Pass 3 (derived); 60/60 tests; 50/50 signals live

### Phase 1A-iii — IMF/OECD fiscal lenses ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-18)
- `fetch_imf_series()` added to `loader.py` using IMF Datamapper REST API (no auth, ISO-3 country codes, forecast-year filter)
- 9 new active bindings: TFP (RTFPNAUSA632NRUG), PPI broad (PPIACO), household debt/GDP (HDTGPDUSQ163N), corporate debt (BCNSDODNS), federal deficit (FYFSD), interest payments (FYOINT), govt revenue % GDP (WB), IMF primary balance (`pb`), IMF structural balance (`GGCB_G01_PGDP_PT`); deferred climate slot added
- Pass 3 (IMF) + Pass 4 (derived) in pipeline; 79/79 tests; 59/59 signals live
- All ⚠ VERIFY items in active config resolved; no empty results; 0 sanity warnings
- IMF current-year estimates and future forecasts are excluded from observation signals

### Phase 1B — Composites & Snapshot Engine ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-18)
- `indicators/composites.py`: Growth Score + Inflation Score (weighted Z-score composites per `composites.yaml`), Regime Quadrant (4-season), Confidence (direction-agreement fraction), Disequilibrium Score (mean absolute standardized distance from declared equilibrium across 5 force groups)
- `indicators/models.py`: `CompositeSnapshot` Pydantic model
- `store/store.py`: `composites` table, `upsert_composites()`, `query_composite_history()`
- `pipeline.py`: Pass 5 — runs composites engine, upserts to DB
- 558 monthly US composite snapshots stored; 91 tests passing
- Historical narrative: COVID-2020 Disinflationary Slowdown → 2021 Inflationary Boom → 2022 Inflationary Boom (employment Z-scores strongly positive; spec's "2022 = Stagflation" assumption was imprecise — Stagflation label correctly appears from Mar 2023 when growth Z-scores turn negative) → 2023–2026 Stagflation
- Current (Jun 2026): Stagflation — Growth=−0.048 / Inflation=+0.428 / Confidence=48% / Disequilibrium=0.702; 8/8 inflation signals active

### Phase 1C — Streamlit Dashboard (US proof) ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-18)
- `dashboard/app.py` full rewrite: HUD (Regime Quadrant · Confidence · Momentum arrows · Disequilibrium), 4-quadrant Plotly scatter with 12-month connected trail, What Changed feed (top-8 Z-score movers), Cross-Signal Conflict Panel, Geopolitical-Risk Overlay placeholder (WGI deferred)
- Accordion drill-downs for all 10 lens groups; per-signal rows with SVG sparklines, percentile color badges, Z-score, direction arrow, quality badges, causal-linkage tooltips
- `tests/test_dashboard.py`: 39 tests (35 unit, 4 integration); total suite 131/131 passing
- `INDICATORS_TESTING=1` env guard prevents `main()` from executing on import in tests
- Docker acceptance gate: `docker compose up dashboard` → port :8501 serves HTML; pipeline exits 0
- Geopolitical-Risk Overlay (WGI / Lens H): shows deferred placeholder with link to G-03 resolution path
- **All HTML rendering uses `st.html()`** — Streamlit 1.39+ silently ignores `unsafe_allow_html=True` in `st.markdown()`; `st.html()` is the correct API for raw HTML blocks in any future dashboard work

### Phase 1D — Dash Charting View ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-19)
- `dashboard/charting.py`: Plotly Dash app on port :8502; 3-tab layout (Chart Overlay, Yield Curve, Regime History)
- `dashboard/charting_data.py`: DuckDB query helpers; parquet cache-first for FRED yield maturities
- `config/chart_series.yaml`: 50-series catalog (9 groups) + 6 yield curve maturities (3M/1Y/2Y/5Y/10Y/30Y)
- Series selector sidebar (`dcc.Checklist` grouped by lens); multi-pane subplot builder; shared X-axis; independent Y-axes; `hovermode="x unified"`
- Time-horizon presets (1Y/3Y/5Y/10Y/MAX) + range slider shared above all tabs
- Yield Curve tab: full term structure at selectable date + optional comparison date + historical 10Y-2Y spread bar chart
- `dashboard/charting_lc/`: Option B skeleton (FastAPI + TradingView Lightweight Charts) committed, deferred
- 156/156 tests passing; Docker acceptance gate `:8502` HTTP 200

### Phase 1E — Data Explorer ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-19)
- `dashboard/explorer_data.py`: signal overview query (59 signals, latest snapshot + obs count + freq label + quality flags), full history loader, gap detector (flags gaps >2× expected release cycle), raw-cache vs processed comparator (parquet → DB delta), anomaly flag (|Z|>3), descriptive stats per signal
- `dashboard/explorer.py`: layout + 8 callbacks; signal browser DataTable (filter by force/flags, sortable); 4-subtab detail panel:
  - **Time Series**: dual-pane chart (raw value + Z-score), equilibrium reference line, stale-point markers, ±2/3σ bands, 6 stat cards, reference spot-check input (enter value from provider → shows DB delta + %)
  - **Observations**: full paginated table with anomaly/stale row highlighting, CSV download
  - **Quality & Gaps**: metadata card, quality flag badges (green/red), gap detection table
  - **Raw vs Processed**: parquet cache value vs DB processed value side by side; delta/% columns; rows with |Δ%|>5% highlighted
- Wired as "🔬 Data Explorer" tab in `dashboard/charting.py`
- 31 original feature tests; 203/203 repository tests passing after code-review regressions; Docker :8502 healthy

### Phase 1F — Long-Term Debt Stress Indicator ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-19)
- `config/longterm_stress.yaml`: all tunable parameters (weights, rolling windows, coverage threshold, bands, staleness) annotated with `# TUNABLE` — no values buried in code; `staleness:` section with `stale_weight_halflife`, `stale_min_weight_fraction`, `max_carry_quarters`, `extrapolation` gate
- `indicators/longterm_stress.py`: 7-component weighted Z-score composite; rolling Z at quarterly (window=40) or annual (window=10); shift(1) statistical look-ahead protection; unit-safe derived ratios; point-in-time source dates; **Gap 1**: exponential half-life decay by excess staleness lag; **Gap 2**: carry-forward limit + YAML-gated model-based extrapolation (`_extrapolate_z_score`); **Gap 3**: structured stale strings `"cid:lag_q"` + `extrapolated_components` field
- `indicators/models.py`: `DebtStressSnapshot` with `stale_components` (`"cid:lag_q"` format) + `extrapolated_components`
- `store/store.py`: `debt_stress_snapshots` table + `upsert_debt_stress()` + `query_debt_stress_history()`; migration adds `extrapolated_components` column
- `indicators/pipeline.py`: Pass 6 — 185 quarterly snapshots; latest (2026-Q1): stress=+0.488, 5/7 components, retained=72.7%
- `dashboard/charting_data.py`: `load_debt_stress_history()` + `load_debt_stress_component_dates()` (queries signals table for last `as_of` per underlying signal)
- `dashboard/app.py`: HUD Debt Stress cell with stale/extrap badges; `_parse_stale_components()` handles `"cid:lag_q"` and legacy plain-`"cid"` format
- `dashboard/charting.py`: "📉 Debt Stress" tab — **full-width** component table (freq, config wt, eff wt post-decay, last data date, Z-score bar, status/reason); `BLANK` rows explain carry expiry + last known value; chart pushed below; `_parse_stress_components()` + `_fmt_period()` + `_carry_expires()` helpers
- `tests/test_longterm_stress.py`: 42 tests covering staleness gaps 1–3, statistical look-ahead, sign convention, coverage, unit conversion, band labels, config integrity, and country guards; 249/249 repository tests passing

### Phase 2 — Country Rollout (one at a time)
Order: Eurozone → Japan → UK → South Korea → China → India → Brazil → Saudi Arabia → Russia.
Each country requires: binding instantiation → series verification → spot-check vs. public reference → `vintage_available` set honestly → human sign-off.

### Phase 3 — Back-Test / Regime Replay
Replay named scenarios (1970s stagflation, 2008 GFC, 2020 COVID) using FRED vintages. Confirm quadrant classifier lands in expected season with no look-ahead bias.

## Deferred / Out of Scope (do not build)

- Risk-parity weighting, volatility estimation, correlation matrices, portfolio construction → **Allocation Layer project**
- EIU / ICRG political-risk scores → use WB WGI as live substitute
- EM-DAT disaster losses (Lens I) → build slot + deferred binding only
- SWF holdings → deferred
- CEIC / Bloomberg / Refinitiv → only if a license is provided
- NBS China automated pull → use WB/IMF harmonized for now
- Russia Rosstat/CBR automated → use WB/IMF harmonized; flag gaps
