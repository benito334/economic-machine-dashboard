## 2026-06-18 — Session 2: Phase 1A-i Code Complete

**Done:**
- Scaffolded full project structure: `indicators/`, `store/`, `config/`, `tests/`, `dashboard/`
- `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- `indicators/models.py`: Pydantic `CountryBinding` + `Signal` contract
- `indicators/loader.py`: FRED fetcher with parquet disk cache, tenacity retry, TTL-based freshness
- `indicators/transform.py`: YoY%, level/spread pass-through, momentum period maps
- `indicators/normalize.py`: Z-score, percentile, direction, staleness, `build_signals`, `sanity_check`
- `indicators/pipeline.py`: full orchestrator (Pass 1 FRED, Pass 2 derived series, sanity gates, `--refresh`/`--latest` flags)
- `store/store.py`: DuckDB schema init, idempotent upsert, `query_latest`, `query_series`
- `config/us_bindings.yaml`: 29 FRED bindings (lenses A–E + Master, all `verified: true`) + 4 derived
- `config/composites.yaml`: Growth/Inflation Score weights (ADR-005), disequilibrium forces
- **51 tests written and passing** (test_transform, test_normalize, test_store)
- Pushed to https://github.com/benito334/indicators-machine

**Pipeline run results (2026-06-18):**
- 36/37 FRED OK, 1 empty (GACDISA066MSFRBPHI — bad ID in spec), 0 errors, 0 sanity warnings
- Fixed PMI proxy ID: `GACDISA066MSFRBPHI` → `GACDFSA066MSFRBPHI` (one char off)
- After fix: **37/37 signals OK, 0 empty, 0 errors, 0 sanity warnings**
- Discovered: all ICE BofA series on FRED truncated to 2023-06-19 (licensing change). HY spread has only 787 obs. Documented as G-10. BAA10Y (since 1986) is the primary long-history credit spread.
- DuckDB now has signals across: lenses A–E + Master, 33 FRED series + 4 derived
- Total rows: ~85,000+ time-series observations stored

**Current signal state (as of 2026-06-17/18):**
- Growth: cooling (payrolls +0.3% YoY P=22%, capacity util 76% P=23%)
- Inflation: above target (core PCE 3.3% YoY P=72%, core CPI 2.8% P=58%)
- Policy: mild restriction (real fed funds +0.81%, real 10Y yield +2.14% at P=88%)
- Credit: very loose (Baa spread 1.55% at P=9%, HY spread 2.63%)
- Regime: Disinflationary Slowdown / mild Stagflation border

**Next session:**
- Phase 1A-ii: add World Bank lenses (F external, G capital/currency, H governance, demographics)
- OR begin Phase 1B composites engine if user prefers to see the regime quadrant first

**Blockers:** None — pipeline is fully operational.

## 2026-06-18 — Session 1: Project Bootstrap

**Done:**
- Read and analyzed `docs/project_plan.md` (Master Technical Specification v2).
- Identified key weaknesses and gaps in the plan (see session-checklist.md).
- Created all project documentation:
  - `CLAUDE.md` — authoritative session guide with locked-in paths, rules, stack, phase map
  - `worklog.md` — this file
  - `session-checklist.md` — per-session pre/post checklist + open items
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-001-duckdb-signal-store.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-002-apscheduler-orchestration.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-003-alfred-vintages-deferred.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-004-philly-fed-pmi-proxy.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-005-composite-weights.md`

**Locked in (confirmed by user):**
- Data path: `/mnt/data/project_data/all_weather/indicators_machine/`
- DB path: `/mnt/data/db/all_weather/indicators_machine/`
- Rule: Dockerize everything
- Rule: Use existing tools/packages before building from scratch

**Next session should start with:**
- Phase 1A: scaffold directory structure, `requirements.txt`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`
- Define Pydantic models for `IndicatorConcept`, `CountryBinding`, `Signal` in `indicators/models.py`
- Write DuckDB schema in `store/store.py`
- Write FRED fetcher with cache in `indicators/loader.py`

**Blockers:**
- `FRED_API_KEY` must be provisioned before ingestion can run. Check with `echo $FRED_API_KEY`.
- `EIA_API_KEY` required for commodity data (Lens B / crude oil) — lower priority, Phase 1A can proceed without it if crude oil is fetched via FRED `DCOILWTICO` (no key needed via FRED).
